# Get Shit Done v2

**An ADHD-friendly productivity app designed to help users prioritize, focus, and execute tasks through gamified micro-tasking, dynamic visuals, and dopamine-driven feedback loops.**

Created by Rutik Jadhav.

    *   Level up your profile.
    *   Maintain daily streaks.
    *   Unlock achievements.

*   **Dopamine Progress Bar:** Visualize daily micro-task completion.
*   **Journaling:** Daily journal entries with mood tracking.

*   **Progress Dashboard:**
    *   Visualize task completion trends (daily, weekly).
    *   Track XP growth over time.
    *   See task category distribution (pie chart).
    *   View overall progress (level, streak, achievements).
*   **Achievements System:** Unlock badges for milestones and consistent effort.
*   **Virtual Focus Plant:** A small visual plant that grows as you accumulate XP, symbolizing your focus and growth.
*   **Modern Glassmorphic UI:** Aesthetically pleasing interface with blur effects, translucency, and subtle glows.
*   **Interactive Animations:** Smooth transitions and animations to enhance user experience.
*   **Local Storage Persistence:** All your tasks, progress, and journal entries are saved in your browser's local storage.
*   **Data Management:** Export and import your app data (tasks, journal, progress) as a JSON file.
*   **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

*   **React 19:** (Loaded via esm.sh CDN, no build step)
*   **TypeScript:** For type safety and better developer experience.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** (Loaded via CDN) For utility-first styling.
*   **Recharts:** (Loaded via esm.sh CDN) For rendering charts in the dashboard.
*   **HTML5 & Modern JavaScript (ES Modules):** Runs directly in modern browsers.
*   **No Build Step:** Designed for simplicity and direct browser execution.

## How to Run

This application is designed to run directly in a modern web browser that supports ES Modules and Import Maps.

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files).**
2.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser.**

    *   If you encounter issues with `file:///` protocol (especially related to module loading or local storage access in some browsers), you can serve the files using a simple local HTTP server.
    *   One easy way is to use `npx serve` (Node.js required):
        ```bash
        npx serve .
        ```
        Then open the URL provided by the server (usually `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:5000`).
